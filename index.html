			<p>It is the year 1772 in colonial Virginia. You are Betty, an enslaved black woman at Mount Vernon: the estate of George Washington. You work there as a seamstress. Previously, you were owned by Daniel and Martha Parke Custis: one of the wealthiest and most prominent families in Virginia at the time. Daniel died in 1757 and Martha received one-third of his estate, the rest going to their kids. You, Betty, are part of this one-third. Martha soon finds a husband: George Washington, who at the time was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses and was a place where martha could relieve herself of the duties that came with the ownership of so much property.</p>
			<p>Once you begin working at Mount Vernon, you meet a man named Andrew Judge, a white indentured tailor from England. You fall in love, but you are also interested in your childhood sweetheart Finny, who you were enslaved with at the Custis estate. You want to start a family with one of them and have a child but are torn between the two people you love.</p>

Your mother is a seamstress at the Mansion House, and you are also called to work there as a waiter at a young age. Following George Washington's victory over the British, securing American independence, Washington gets elected as president, and you get chosen to accompany him to New York. </p>
			<p>The country's capital later moves to Philadelphia, and you and the other slaves transfer there with the president. In Philadelphia, slavery is dying out, so there is a law granting enslaved people freedom within six months of living there, but Washington does not want to lose you and the other slaves that accompanied him to office. Washington finds a loophole: if he sends away slaves and brings them back, their six-month timer will reset, so he takes advantage of this and creates a system to keep his slaves. On one of your trips away from Philadelphia, you drown while navigating a river near Havre De Grace, Maryland.</p>

You, the other enslaved, the first family, and their advisors live in the same house on Cherry Street. There aren't enough people to work at the house so Washington hires fourteen new white servants to live in or work a day job at the house. You now live in close quarters with free whites.

Although they are free, they are very close to falling into poverty and are in a very vulnerable position, because at any moment, their job could be replaced by a slave. There was also a lack of opportunity for people in such a position. Not knowing what to expect when you escape and become free, you are frightened and never even attempt to run away.</p>

Martha, who had already lost many people in her life, feared the possibility of George dying.

During a three-month visit to Mount Vernon, where the family resided while their belongings got sent to Philadelphia, you realize that free blacks in the north are living much better lives than you will ever live as an enslaved person.

		<p>Some months pass and unexpectedly you and a couple other slaves are brought back to Mount Vernon. On the way there, one of the slaves who works with you tells you about a law in Philadelphia that guarantees slaves freedom after 6 months of residing in the city. After some thought, you understand that your chance at freedom is gone: your six-month timer will be reset once you return to Philadelphia, and who knows how long until you get another chance at escape. Five years pass, and sadly, on one of these trips, you are taken to the estate of Eliza Parke Custis, Martha's granddaughter, in Virginia. Eliza recently married, and you were a wedding gift from the First Lady to her granddaughter. You are now stuck in Virginia forever, without your family or anybody you know. </p>

		<p>Washington, after realizing that his slaves are aware of this law, understands that his head chef, Hercules, can free himself lawfully. Washington could only hope he stays. Hercules stays, but maybe some other person won't. This means that he has to spend extra time, effort, and money into cycling you and the other every six months. This shows how dependent George is on you and the other enslaved, and not the other way around. </p>
		<p>Often, Martha takes you with her to large social events, and you get a chance to interact with and see the wealthy upper class and their slaves, the social "elite", and powerful politics. At one of these events, Martha dismisses you until she is done with a private and important conversation, and you see a group of free blacks gesturing for you to come over. You know you are forbidden from speaking to them but you are tempted to meet new people in this city. Maybe they can help you escape!</p>

Free blacks who support your escape can scope out dangers, figure out a route for you, find possible escape routes and methods or give you resources for your escape. They are able to do this because as free people, they have access to all the maps, transportation, and visuals of the city. You try to plan an escape, but do not know what to expect. You carry out your unfinished and not thought through plan, get overwhelmed, and pass out in the middle of the street.

After a couple years of going back and forth from Philadelphia to Mount Vernon, you run into your friends at an event. You talk about your lives, hopes, dreams. But all of this is crushed once you find out that Eliza Parke Custis, Martha's granddaughter, is getting married and that you are to be given to her as a wedding gift. </p>
		<p> You realize it is time to act: Eliza lives in Virginia, and once you leave Philadelphia, you will never come back. It is time to carefully plan your escape: you must decide whether to flee to New York, which has a higher slave than free black population, but also a richer economy and with you somewhat knowing New York, having lived there for a year and a half with Washington, or New Hampshire, which has a higher percentage of free blacks, but significantly less economic opportunity and flourishment. New York is closer, while New Hampshire is farther from Pennsylvania. Where will you go?</p>

		<p>New York may seem better, but having lived there for almost two years with the most well-known person in the country strikes a high risk of being recognized by someone and being turned in, due to helping dugitive slaves being against the law after the Fugitive Slave Act got passed. Also, since New York is closer to Pennsylvania than New Hampshire, and it is the first state north of Pennsylvania, it will be one of the states Washington searches first. You, although, do not get a calm explanation such as this one: you learn it the hard way. You get recognized by a friend of Martha's in the city market and captured. The Washingtons decide not to delay with the gifting of Eliza's wedding present.</p>

		<p>Good choice! New Hampshire is farther away from the place you escaped from: if you are hiding from something, it is always better to be further away from it. New York being familiar may seem appealing, but it is in fact very dangerous: you face the risk of being recognized, which could ultimately lead to your capture. </p>
		<p>You present this descision to your friends and they get to work: they look for ways of getting to New Hampshire with minimal risk and come up with two options: you could travel up the Delaware River and then get to New Hampshire via other rivers, or you could make the whole trip by land. On land, you will not have to face the danger of being caught on the ship you will be traveling in, as the news will most likely have an advertisement, granting anyone who returns you to the Washingtons money. Although, going by land will be dangerous, as you will be alone, not ready to face any unexpected weather conditions, with no guarantee to food or water, and the trip will take much longer, increasing the time frame for you to be caught. </p>
